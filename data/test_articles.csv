Are you one of the 500,000 people living in the UK's very own Bristol?
Do you like reading about the race to commoditize that feeling that you so cherish? If you answered yes-yes and/or no-yes, then this article is for you.
Your friends at WaveGarden just announced they're breaking ground in Bristol. Literally. As in, with machines. Maybe metaphorically too — the pool will be the first in Europe to feature "The Cove" technology, which promises….
-6 foot waves!
-1000 quality waves an hour!
-A system that can accommodate 80 users at the same time?
Users?
Yep, they rolled with "users" in the press release? Very PC. Very forward. Does that mean you can SUP, kayak, kayak SUP, or SUP kayak straight out of your local strip mall? That has yet to be determined.
But if all goes according to plan, the pool will be open in late 2019.
You'll recall news first circulated about the WaveGarden coming to Bristol about 6 years ago. Now, there are two things you can take away from that.
1) It takes a very long time to plan and build a wave pool.
2) They're trying to steal some thunder from the Founders' Cup.
Coincidence they announce the Bristol wave pool the same week that the surf world (and CBS) will set its gaze towards just-outside-of-Lemoore?
Fuck no.
This, folks, is a classic case of attempted thunder theft.
This announcement is about as coincidental as Kelly releasing the first Surf Ranch clip immediately after Adriano de Souza won the World Title.

The problem is, they're trying to out-Slater Slater. Nobody steals thunder like him.
It's just more proof that the Wave Pool Arms Race is getting hotter and hotter or colder and colder depending on how committed you are.
Right now, we've got a Wave Garden. A Surf Ranch. A Surf Lake. And the ocean.
I'm not very committed, but decisions, decisions…
